        <p>
            The Village is a project developed through IED Madrid and Imaginarium that aims to create a community based family structure beneficial for holistic child development.   
        </p>

        <p>
            As an outcome, the project created a time sharing platform that creates a community of support around a new child to help parents raise them well and develop their full potential.

            Through Design Thinking and UI, The Village aims to give proper support to parents, help them fulfill theirs and their children's needs through their families, close friends and neighbors.
