        <h3>Project description</h3>
        <p>
            Vent is a UX, Design Thinking and Communication Project. Focused on those who feel lost in their lives, who have spent their youth wondering if they are the correct path, surrounded by the correct people, doing the right things.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is a project that aims to create a space of mindfulness and introspection for young people who need to understand themselves so they can work towards a better journey, and a better life. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Developed under the academic assistance of IED Madrid, with Design Research, Thinking, UX and Visual tools. The outcome of the project was a digital app designed with the focus on a calm mind, and on those who need a moment to think into themselves.
